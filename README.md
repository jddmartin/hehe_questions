# Wavicles and weakest bond --- Questions for the curious and a work in progress!

The following questions are aimed at levels ranging from high-school to graduate students.  We will update and improve these questions based on feedback.

Some questions require looking at the original paper, which can be downloaded here:

If this is your first icy plunge into the scientific literature: enjoy!

## Introductory (high-school/first year)

1. What have you learned so far about elements like helium that make it hard to believe a bond is likely to form between two of their atoms? [Answer.](./answers/noblegases.md)

2. The speed of light in a medium can be related to the light's frequency is modeled using the equation $$v=f\lambda$$. In this equation, $v$ is the light's speed in that medium, $f$ is the light wave's frequency, and $\lambda$ is the light's wavelength. Using this equation, convince yourself why "frequency doubling" is the same as saying "wavelength halving" (although one rolls off the tongue a bit better). [Answer.](./answers/frequencydoubling.md) (Hint: If you would like to use numbers, pick any frequency you want and double it! See what happens to the wavelength.)

## Intermediate

1.  The helium atoms (and dimers) are travelling at XX m/s.  Compute the expected angle of the first diffraction peak.  How well does your number agree with Fig. 2 of the paper?\
[Answer.](./answers/compute_diffraction_angle.md)

2. The peaks shown in Fig. 2 of the paper have a "width"; i.e., the signal attributed to helium dimer doesn't just appear at one angle but over a range of angles.  
a. List as many factors as possible that could contribute to these widths.  
b. Bonus: Be quantiative and determine how much each of these factors would contribute to the observed width.\
[Answer.](./answers/peak_widths.md)

3. Suppose that the experiment was performed with helium atoms travelling at a different speed.  What problems would you expect to arise if the atoms are travelling  
a. more slowly?, or   
b. more quickly?\
[Answer.](./answers/different_speeds.md)

4. Explain how the Heisenberg uncertainty principle prevents the two helium atoms from sitting motionless, at the bottom of the weakly attractive well describing their interaction.\

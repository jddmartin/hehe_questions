# Wavicles and weakest bond --- Questions for the curious and a work in progress!

The following questions are aimed at levels ranging from high-school to graduate students.  We will update and improve these questions based on feedback.

Some questions require looking at the original paper, which can be downloaded [here](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.470772).

If this is your first icy plunge into the scientific literature: enjoy!

## Introductory (high-school/first year)
[Curricular References.](./answers/curricularreference.md)

1. What have you learned so far about elements like helium that make it hard to believe a bond is likely to form between two of their atoms? [Answer.](./answers/noblegases.md)


2. The speed of light in a medium can be related to the light's frequency is modeled using the equation $v=f \lambda $. In this equation, $v$ is the light's speed in that medium, $f$ is the light wave's frequency, and $\lambda$ is the light's wavelength. Using this equation, convince yourself why "frequency doubling" is the same as saying "wavelength halving" (although one rolls off the tongue a bit better). (Hint: If you would like to use numbers, pick any frequency you want and double it! See what happens to the wavelength.)  [Answer.](./answers/frequencydoubling.md) 


3. If helium atoms are travelling with a wavelength of 1 micrometer and the angle between the first order constructive diffraction spots and the central maximum is 5$\deg$, then how far apart are the gratings? Using the de Broglie Relationship, determine the momentum of the helium atoms. [Answer.](./answers/Diffractiongratingdistance.md)


4. Consider what would happen if two atoms were too close together. Why would they not want to bond? Is that the same reason for why two atoms too far apart would not want to bond? Explain your reasoning. [Answer.](./answers/Whywontatomsbond.md) 

5. If red light at 632.8 nm gets frequency doubled through a crystal then diffracted through a grating, some of the red light produces a pattern along side the frequency doubled light. If both the red and its frequency doubled light enter through the same grating, and the 2 $2^{nd}$ order constructive interference maxima are at an angle $30\degree$ from the incident direction, then what is the grating spacing?

## Intermediate

1.  In Figure 2 of the paper the first order helium dimer diffraction peak is observed at angle 1.0 mrad ("milli-radians") away from the beam direction.\
a. What is the de Broglie wavelength of these helium dimers (in m)?  (You will need to look up the grating spacing from the paper.)\
b. What is the speed of these helium dimers?\
[Answer.](./answers/wavelength_and_speed.md)

3. The peaks shown in Fig. 2 of the paper have a "width"; i.e., the signal attributed to helium dimer doesn't just appear at one angle but over a range of angles. List as many factors as possible that could contribute to these widths.\
[Answer.](./answers/peak_widths.md)

4. Suppose that the experiment was performed with helium atoms travelling at a different speed.  What problems would you expect to arise if the atoms are travelling\
a. more slowly?, or   
b. more quickly?\
[Answer.](./answers/different_speeds.md)

5. Explain how the Heisenberg uncertainty principle prevents the two helium atoms from sitting motionless, at the bottom of the weakly attractive well describing their interaction.\

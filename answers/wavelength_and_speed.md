# Answer:

To apply the diffraction equation:

$n \lambda = d \sin \theta$

we need to know the grating spacing $d$.

In the third paragraph of the paper, we find that $d=200$ nm.

Since we are considering the first order diffraction peak, $n=1$, so that we may compute the de Broglie wavelength by:

$\lambda = d \sin \theta$.

Substituting $d=200 \times 10^{-9}$ m and $\theta = 1 \times 10^{-3}$ rad gives:

$\lambda \approx 200 \times 10^{-12}$ m.

# Answer

The Heisenberg uncertainty relationship is:

$$m \Delta x \Delta v \ge \hbar / 2 $$

where $$m$$ is the mass of the particle, $$\Delta x $$ is the uncertainty in position, and $$\Delta v$$ is the uncertainty in speed.

If the atoms were sitting motionless, at the bottom of the attractive well, then $\Delta x$ would be zero and it would be impossible to satisfy the Heisenberg uncertainty relationship.

More generally, as $$\Delta x$$ decreases (we say that the particle is becoming more *localized*), then the uncertainty in speed must increase.

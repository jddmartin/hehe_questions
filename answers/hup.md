# Answer

The Heisenberg uncertainty relationship is:

$$m \Delta x \Delta v \ge \hbar / 2 $$

where $m$ is the mass of a particle, $\Delta x$ is the uncertainty in position, and $\Delta v$ is the uncertainty in speed.

Although this equation is normally applied to a single particle, it can also be applied to the relative motion of two particles, where $m$ is now the *reduced mass* of the two particle system, $\Delta x$ is the separation of the two particles, and $\Delta v$ is their relative speed.

If the atoms were sitting motionless, at the bottom of the attractive well, then $\Delta x$ would be zero and it would be impossible to satisfy the Heisenberg uncertainty relationship.

More generally, as $\Delta x$ decreases (we say that the particle is becoming more *localized*), then the uncertainty in speed must increase.

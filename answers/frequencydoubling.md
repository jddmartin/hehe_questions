The equation presented, $$v=f\lambda$$ relates the frequency and the wavelength of light. Let's rearrange this to isolate lambda.


$$\lambda = \frac{v}{f}$$


Now, let's imagine that we have one light beam travelling at frequency f, like 300THz. (A Terahertz is 1 trillion Hertz or $10^{12}$ Hz). If the frequency doubles, then it goes to 600THz. At 300THz, the wavelength of light would end up being about 1 $\mu m$, or 1 micrometer. A micrometer is a millionth of a meter, or $10^{-6}m$.
At the doubled frequency, the light  would be twice the wavelength, or 0.5 $\mu m$. We can also express this algebraically (that is, in variable form)

Let's go back to the equation above. If we replace $f$ with $2f$, then you obtain:

$$\lambda = \frac{v}{2f}$$

If you adjust the equation to separate the variables $v$ and $f$ from the constant number, you get:

$$\lambda = \frac{1}{2}\frac{v}{f}$$
$$\lambda_{doubled}=\frac{1}{2}\lambda_{original}$$

As shown, the wavelength corresponding to frequency doubled light is at half the value of its original.

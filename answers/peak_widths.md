# Answer

1. atoms have a range of speeds, thus de Broglie wavelengths, thus diffraction angles.

2. the detector has a certain "width" over which it detects, collecting signal over a range of diffraction angles.

3. the transverse coherence width of the beam will contribute to the width (smaller coherence widths lead to larger spreads).

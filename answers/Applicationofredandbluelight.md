## Work in progress!! Full sol'n coming soon :)

We know that the e
Where d is the grating spacing, is the angle of the light's deviation from the incident direction of travel, m is the order of diffraction, and $\lambda$

is the wavelength of the light in nanometers.

What do you know so far about the red light?

a) It has a wavelength of 632.8

b) Some of the red light gets frequency doubled.

We know the wavelength of the red light, but not anything else. We have to know some parameters about the blue light now to finish solving our problem.

What do we know about the blue light?

a) We have the angle of the light forming the

order maxima from the original incident direction.

b) The blue light is frequency doubled from the red, and thus its parameters relate to the red somehow.

How would you conclude this problem? Your next step is to figure out how to relate the red and blue light parameters to finish solving your question.
